# Bug Fixes Summary

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Pothole Detection Video/Image Inconsistency** ✅ FIXED

- **Issue**: Backend had video endpoint but frontend was configured as image-only
- **Fix**:
  - Added `pothole_detection_video_view` function
  - Updated frontend configuration to support both video and image
  - Fixed URL routing to use correct view function

### 2. **YouTube URL Validation Issues** ✅ FIXED

- **Issue**: Too permissive validation, accepted invalid URLs
- **Fix**:
  - Improved regex to validate actual video IDs
  - Added backend URL validation before download
  - Better error handling for download failures

### 3. **File Cleanup Race Conditions** ✅ FIXED

- **Issue**: Used deprecated `tempfile.mktemp()` causing race conditions
- **Fix**:
  - Replaced with `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)`
  - Added proper error handling for cleanup failures
  - Added logging for cleanup operations

### 4. **Error Handling Inconsistencies** ✅ FIXED

- **Issue**: Fragile error code detection using string matching
- **Fix**:
  - Added structured error code detection
  - Improved error message parsing
  - Added more specific error codes

### 5. **Resource Leakage in Job Processing** ✅ FIXED

- **Issue**: Job slots might not be released in all error scenarios
- **Fix**:
  - Added proper exception handling in finally block
  - Ensured job slots are always released
  - Added error logging for slot release failures

### 6. **Frontend/Backend Type Mismatches** ✅ FIXED

- **Issue**: Wildlife detection frontend supported both video/image but backend only had video
- **Fix**:
  - Added `tracking_image` function for wildlife detection
  - Updated task processor to handle image inputs
  - Added proper image processing support

### 7. **Missing Validation for Required Fields** ✅ FIXED

- **Issue**: Basic JSON validation for emergency lines and lobby zones
- **Fix**:
  - Added comprehensive structure validation
  - Validated required fields for each line/zone
  - Added specific error messages for validation failures

### 8. **File Extension Handling Issues** ✅ FIXED

- **Issue**: Defaulted to `.mp4` for any file without extension
- **Fix**:
  - Added job-type-specific default extensions
  - Image jobs default to `.jpg`, video jobs to `.mp4`
  - Better extension detection logic

### 9. **Memory Management Issues** ✅ FIXED

- **Issue**: GPU memory cleanup failures were ignored
- **Fix**:
  - Added proper error handling for GPU cleanup
  - Added logging for cleanup failures
  - Ensured cleanup doesn't affect job completion

### 10. **Frontend State Management Issues** ✅ FIXED

- **Issue**: Potential state corruption in upload form
- **Fix**:
  - Added error boundary handling
  - Wrapped critical operations in try-catch
  - Added safe wrapper functions for all handlers

## Additional Improvements

### 11. **Better File Cleanup** ✅ IMPROVED

- Added proper error handling for file deletion
- Added logging for cleanup operations
- Ensured cleanup happens even if exceptions occur

### 12. **Enhanced Error Boundaries** ✅ ADDED

- Added comprehensive error handling for frontend operations
- Added safe wrapper functions for all critical operations
- Added user-friendly error messages

### 13. **Improved YouTube Download Validation** ✅ ENHANCED

- Added URL validation before download
- Added better error handling for download failures
- Added specific error codes for different failure types

### 14. **Wildlife Detection Image Support** ✅ ADDED

- Added `tracking_image` function for image processing
- Updated task processor to handle image inputs
- Added proper image validation and processing

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test pothole detection** with both video and image uploads
2. **Test YouTube URL validation** with various URL formats
3. **Test error handling** by uploading invalid files
4. **Test resource cleanup** by monitoring memory usage
5. **Test wildlife detection** with both video and image inputs
6. **Test emergency count and lobby detection** with various annotation formats

## Files Modified
